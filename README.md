# JPACRUDProject

## Topics Covered
CRUD, JPA, Gradle, JPQL, SQL, Controllers, DAO, JSP files,
MySQL Workbench Data Modeling, Spring Boot, hibernate

## Walkthrough
The user can select from options to Add a dinosaur, View all Dinosaurs,
View Carnivores, View Herbivores, or search by keyword from name and description(this feature is still under construction at the time of this writing).

These filters will present a list of dinosaurs to the user where the user can select on an individual dinosaur to view its information. When viewing the dinosaur the user has the option to edit or delete that dinosaur.

## Struggles and Lessons Learned
I was cruising through in the beginning without mush issue but eventually ran in to some hurdles when creating the update function. Largely because of submit button labeling. I had very high ambitions for this project and probably tried to incorporate too much even though in mind it still feels as if it is not enough. The overall styling is not pretty or organized how I would like due to time spent on debugging and overcoming unexpected issues. I learned a great deal about all of the topics listed above while doing this project. It really was fun actually, even the challenging parts I just wish I had more time to play with it and really make it up to the standard that I have imagined it could be as it is not there yet.
